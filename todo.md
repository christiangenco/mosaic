# Objective

* Make learning personalized (ie: not teaching to the middle), scalable (ie: not one person talking to 20 kids), and fun (ie: gamified)

# Next

* make public
* invite Ricky
* CSS and Javascript lessons
* comments on submissions
* assign custom points? one more button with check ++ that's 10x?
* import challenges from Khan Academy, Codecademy, Mosaic last year, notes

# Then

* I can give users emoji badges
* users can create challenges for themselves; private for them unless I make them public

# Nitpicky

* cmd+S to save
* hashes in URL on /challenge/:id to stay on current tab on refresh
* show intermediate state for nil submission on /submissions

---

# Lessons

* italic, underline, link, header, image, hr, br, ul/li, table, div

---

# Inbox

* way to submit surveys?
* users can set their own XP goals? for the class? for the day?
* users can privately message me saying someone else deserves a badge, like helping
* notifications (web sockets?)
* submissions have comments (pop up in model)
* send score updates through websockets
